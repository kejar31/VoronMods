Note 1: All testing has been done on only the wire glands from DFH I can not guarentee they will work with other PG7 glands..

Note 2: The LGX lite version of this was designed around Eytecz LGX Lite Stealthburner CW2 style mount which is awesome.. It is reconemded you check that out yourself

Note 3: The rear umbilical mount is a modified version of Hartk1213.. the only change I had to make was addina slit to the side to allow the realease of cables. all --credit for that mounts design should go to him
